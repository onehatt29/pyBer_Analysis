# pyBer_Analysis

# The purpose of the pyber analysis is to get a visual of total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver. Across multiple cities and areas.





# Based on the analysis the cities with urban areas have a higher driver count and ridership these areas also have higher fares

# The cities with more rural areas ridership is low therefore the drivers count is lower and fares are lower.
