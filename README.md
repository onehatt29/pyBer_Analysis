# Based on the analysis the cities with urban areas have a higher driver count and ridership these areas also have higher fares

# The cities with more rural areas ridership is low therefore the drivers count is lower and fares are lower.

# Based on the data presented I believe it would be beneficial to increase services in the urban areas perhaps increase ride fares in order to capitalize on the high ridership. Perhaps implementing a delivery option for customers.
